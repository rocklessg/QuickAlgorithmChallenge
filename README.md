# How to read this code (for begginers only)
Read the code first, think about what you see, come back to read the Code explanation, then go back and read the code again.

# Code Explanation

/* Thank you for checking..
 * The main logic I used to solve this challenge was to
 
 * Create an empty list/array to hold the result integers
 * Loop through the array of integers to have access to each number in the array
 * Subtract each integer from the target number
 * Check if the resulting integer is present in the array and check whether the sum of both numbers equals target number,
 * If these two conditions are met, add both numbers to the empty list and terminate the process
 * Finally, return the array containing just the two numbers that summed up to the target

 ##Final Note
 If you haven't start yet, try practicing unit test in your projects. Its amazing :)
 
 #Disclaimer!
 There are thousand ways to solve this challenge, don't take my solution too serious,
